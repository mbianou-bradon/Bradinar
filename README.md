# Webinar-platform

A Webinar platform is a software tool used for hosting many events online. The events hosted are seminars, conferences, and workshops. Webinar applications can be downloaded and stored on a computer. It can also be broadcast straight from the web platform. A webinar platform streams live webinars to large groups of individuals.

A dashboard comes included with many interactive webinar platforms. A presenter may use the dashboard to develop new webinars, change enrollment pages, and create automatic emails. The dashboard also contains data regarding webinars, such as the actual number of persons that watched each event.
